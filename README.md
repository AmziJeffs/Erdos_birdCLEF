## Overview

Climate change plays a devastating role in the destruction of natural habitats and the global decline of biodiversity. One way of understanding these effects is by monitoring bird populations as they are highly migratory and have diverse habitual needs. However, traditional methods can be costly and logistically challenging to conduct at large scales. In this project we explore using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) combined with deep learning methods to identify bird specifies using audio samples in the Western Ghats of India. The broader goal of this project is to contribute to the growing literature of deep learning approaches to tackling issues brought by climate change. 

## Description of dataset

We use a dataset provided by the BirdCLEF competition.
